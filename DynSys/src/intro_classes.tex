\subsection{Continuous time}

When $T = R^+$, the dynamical system is called an analog or continuous time dynamical system, and is described by
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{\dd x}{\dd t}(t) &= F(x(t), u(t))\\
        y(t) &= G(x(t), u(t))
    \end{aligned}
\]
where
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        u(t) &\in \Gamma = \RR^m\\
        x(t) &\in \Omega = \RR^n\\
        t(t) &\in \Theta = \RR^p
    \end{aligned}
\]

\subsection{Discrete time}

When $T = R^+$, the dynamical system is called an analog or continuous time dynamical system, and is described by
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        x(t+1) &= F(x(t), u(t))\\
        y(t) &= G(x(t), u(t))
    \end{aligned}
