\begin{theorem}
    For each initial state $x(0) \in \RR^n$, a discrete-time dynamical system admits exactly one solution $x :\NN \ra \RR^n$. If $F(x(t), u(t))$ is continuous and locally \textsc{Lipschitz} with respect to $x$, then for each initial state $x(0) \in \RR^n$, a continuous-time dynamical systems admits exactly one solution $x : \RR^+ \to \RR^n$.
