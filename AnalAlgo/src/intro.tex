Continuous algorithms techniques to design algorithms for discrete problems.

For example, a graph $G=(V,E)$  is a discrete object: this is a discrete input. With such an input, we can find cuts, flows\dots which are discrete output.

We will interest in function $\RR^n \ra \RR$. We assume that the functions are differentiable (multiple times).
