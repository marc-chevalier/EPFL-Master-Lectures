B and E are more compact to avoid cleavage.

\section*{58)}
It could be a site for ADP-regulation

\section*{59)}
True.

\section*{60)}
DNA uses desoxyribose while RNA uses ribose. Moreover, DNA use thymine and RNA uses uracil.

It happened because C become spontaneously U. And in DNA, we want to detect and fix that. In RNA, it is not important since it is often renewed.

\section*{61)}
In neutral environment, DNA has a highly negative charge. In acid environment, its charge is less negative. So during y electrophoresis, DNA will not migrate as well.

\section*{62)}
The bottom one (5' $\ra$ 3').

Promoter, transcription factors.

\section*{63)}
To copy faster.

\section*{64)}
We probably found nucleic acid with a lot of A. ie tails polyA ie RNA.

\section*{65)}
Capping + Poly-Adenosine tail + intron excision.

\section*{66)}
A stop codon is replaced by an amino acid: the protein is longer than it should.
